title: 'Hash and encrypt data using the built-in crypto Node.js library'
description:
  'This script uses the built-in Node.js crypto library to create a SHA-256 hash and a
  Cipher for encrypting data.'
tags: 'javascript, cryptography'

### First see if the built-in Crypto module is available

```javascript
let crypto;
try {
  crypto = require('node:crypto');
  console.log("we're good");
} catch (err) {
  console.log('crypto support is disabled!');
}
```

## Create a SHA-256 hash

With the SHA-256 **hashing** algorithm, the text is converted to a unique "digest" which
cannot be decrypted. The algorithm will always produce the same result, or key, and cannot
be decrypted. This is useful for storing passwords in a database because you can ensure that
the password they typed is correct without saving the password itself.

```javascript
const { createHash } = require('node:crypto');

const msg = "Here's a super secret message to encode";

const hash = createHash('sha256').update(msg).digest('hex');

console.log(hash);

// Prints:
//   3e0e072b5af9cf7dd022e507bbcea46ea8e0054311b713e0129937ef60cf3f4c
```

(Theoretically hashing can be reversed, but the amount of computational energy required is
unfeasible in almost all cases - the big exception being bitcoin mining).

## Encrypt data with a Cipher

The `Cipher` class is used to encrypt data. **Encryption** is the process of turning
readable text into unreadable "Ciphertext", which is used for sending messages without the
risk of third-parties being able to read it. Unlike with hashing, the Ciphertext can be
decrypted using the private key, or password.

```javascript
const { scrypt, randomFill, createCipheriv } = require('node:crypto');

const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
const password = 'Password used to generate key';

// First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
// In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
  randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
    if (err) throw err;

    const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

    let encrypted = cipher.update('some clear text data', 'utf8', 'hex');
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
    console.log(encrypted);
  });
});
```
