  current matchups."

## Setup

First you'll need to get your League ID, which can be found by going to fantasy.espn.com,
navigating to your league and copying the path parameter from the url, which will look
something like `https://fantasy.espn.com/football/league?leagueId=12345`. That will be the
`leagueId` variable in the .ts file below, which you can hardcode in the file or use a .env
file like the snippet uses. Your .env file would look like:

```text
FF_LEAGUE_ID=12345
```

The only dependency is `node-fetch` which is a lightweight Fetch wrapper for Node.js. I
suppose you could also use the fetch library built into Node.js if your project is on a
diet. That's it! Here's the script:

```ts
import { BoxscoreResponse, Matchup, MatchupObj, Scoreboard } from './types';
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const leagueId = process.env.FF_LEAGUE_ID;

const getBoxscores = async (seasonId: number, scoringPeriodId: number) => {
  const BASE_URL = `https://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/${seasonId}/`;
  const scoresUrl =
    BASE_URL +
    `segments/0/leagues/${leagueId}?view=mMatchupScore&view=mTeam&view=mScoreboard&view=mRoster`;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(scoresUrl);
    const data: BoxscoreResponse = await response.json();

    const boxscores: Scoreboard[] = data.schedule
      .filter((x) => x.matchupPeriodId === scoringPeriodId)
      .map((score: Matchup) => {
        let home = data.teams.find((x) => x.id === score.home.teamId);
        let away = data.teams.find((x) => x.id === score.away.teamId);
        let homeMember = data.members.find(
          (member) => home?.owners.findIndex((owner) => owner === member.id) != -1
        )!;
        let awayMember = data.members.find(
          (member) => away?.owners.findIndex((owner) => owner === member.id) != -1
        )!;
        return {
          homeScore: score.home.totalProjectedPointsLive || score.home.totalPoints,
          awayScore: score.away.totalProjectedPointsLive || score.away.totalPoints,
          homeName: home!.location + ' ' + home!.nickname,
          awayName: away!.location + ' ' + away!.nickname,
          homeFirstName: homeMember.firstName,
          awayFirstName: awayMember.firstName,
          homeLastName: homeMember.lastName,
          awayLastName: awayMember.lastName,
          homeRoster: rosterForMatchup(score.home),
          awayRoster: rosterForMatchup(score.away),
        };
      });

    return boxscores;
  } catch (err) {
    throw Error('(in getBoxscores()):' + err);
  }
};

const rosterForMatchup = (matchup: MatchupObj) => {
  if (
    !matchup.rosterForCurrentScoringPeriod ||
    !matchup.rosterForCurrentScoringPeriod.entries
  ) {
    return [];
  } else {
    return matchup.rosterForCurrentScoringPeriod.entries.map((x) => {
      const slot = x.lineupSlotId;
      return {
        name: x.playerPoolEntry.player.fullName,
        projectedPoints: x.playerPoolEntry.player.stats[0].appliedTotal || 0,
        points: x.playerPoolEntry.appliedStatTotal,
        starting: slot < 9 || slot == 17 || slot == 16, // Other slots are bench positions - this could change based on league settings
      };
    });
  }
};
export default getBoxscores;
```

Note that the "starting" field for individual players is based on a roster size of 13 with 4
bench slots and 1 IR slot. If your league settings are different, the "starting" slots could
be different.

The types.ts file:

```ts
// The generated object after filtering/mapping
export interface Scoreboard {
  homeScore: number;
  awayScore: number;
  homeName: string;
  awayName: string;
  homeFirstName: string;
  awayFirstName: string;
  homeLastName: string;
  awayLastName: string;
  homeRoster: Player[];
  awayRoster: Player[];
}

//  ----- Below is what's returned from the API --- //

export interface BoxscoreResponse {
  gameId: number;
  id: number;
  schedule: Matchup[];
  scoringPeriodId: number;
  seasonId: number;
  segmentId: number;
  status: Status;
  members: Member[];
  teams: Team[];
}

export interface Matchup {
  away: MatchupObj;
  home: MatchupObj;
  id: number;
  matchupPeriodId: number;
  winner: Winner;
}

export interface MatchupObj {
  teamId: number;
  totalPoints: number;
  totalPointsLive?: number;
  totalProjectedPointsLive?: number;
  rosterForCurrentScoringPeriod: { lineupSlotId: number; entries: PlayerEntry[] };
}
```
