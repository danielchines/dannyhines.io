title: '[Git] Remove local branches that have been merged'

  'This git command will delete your local branches that have been merged to the main

Git is one of the best and worst parts about software development. Typically during
development, you create branches for features or bug fixes and merge them into the main
branch. On my team we set Github to automatically delete the remote branch when it's merged
into `main`.

Eventually, when you run `git branch` you'll see a bunch of branches, but you can't tell
which have been merged and which ones haven't. Here's a simple example, where I've merged
every branch except the `feat/prisma` branch:

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='/dannyhines.io/delete-local-branches/git-branch-1_x95cs2'
  alt='git branch showing multiple branches'
  width={1902}
  height={308}
/>

## Delete all merged branches:

Now use the following command to delete the branches that have been merged into the main
branch.

```shell
git branch --merged main | grep -v "^\* main" | xargs -n 1 -r git branch -d
```

If your main branch is called something other than "main", change the two instances of
"main" to whatever your main branch is called.

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='/dannyhines.io/delete-local-branches/delete-branches-command_vizbua'
  alt='running the command'
  width={1920}
  height={230}
/>

This deletes all the branches that have been merged, leaving the only `main` and the
`feat/prisma` branch that I'm still working on:

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='/dannyhines.io/delete-local-branches/git-branch-2_rsfq8i'
  alt='git branch showing one branch'
  width={1906}
  height={112}
/>
