## Reddit

As _the front page of the internet_, Reddit is the ultimate collection of internet folklore.
I'm a big fan of memes,
[copypastas](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/9uxpve/hi_can_anyone_tell_me_what_this_subreddit_is_about/)
and stories like
[Bean Dad](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10247075/what-is-bean-dad-story-twitter-meaning).
I started thinking about what memes were like 5 or 10 years ago, and wondering how internet
humor has changed.

There are hundreds of thousands of posts per day, with hundreds of millions of active users.
Because it's been a top website for over a decade, I realized I could make a sort of time
capsule to show what the internet found the most funny/interesting/infuriating at a
particular point in time.

### The Reddit API

Instead of using Reddit's own API, I found an even better search functionality in
[pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/). The Pushshift API was created by a
legend named Jason Baumgartner, who basically scraped the entire Reddit dataset and built an
API on top of it. As far as I can tell it's funded by donations (I donated) and
[r/pushshift](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/) is an active community for using the API.

## The UI

Instead of building out components from scratch, I decided to go with
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for the design system. AntD is an open-source React design
system that gives you tons of reusable components out of the box. Creating a button and
Datepicker, for example, is as easy as

```js
import { Button, DatePicker } from 'antd';

const App = () => (
  <>
    <Button type='primary'>PRESS ME</Button>
    <DatePicker placeholder='select date' />
  </>
);
```

## Adding Predictions

After sending the link in my college GroupMe, my friend Hugh made a suggestion: along with
news, I could display "predictions" from subreddits like r/futurology. It would be
interesting to see what people thought would be possible in the future, and how clearly
wrong some predictions can be. After messing around with the API, I realized that searching
"by [date]" gives the best results, and "predicts", "goal", or "prediction" result in a lot
of false positives.

Here's an interesting example from a random
