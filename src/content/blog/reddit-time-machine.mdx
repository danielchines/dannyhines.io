## Reddit

As _the front page of the internet_, Reddit is the ultimate collection of internet folklore.
I'm a big fan of memes,
[copypastas](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/9uxpve/hi_can_anyone_tell_me_what_this_subreddit_is_about/)
and stories like
[Bean Dad](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10247075/what-is-bean-dad-story-twitter-meaning).
I started thinking about what memes were like 5 or 10 years ago, and wondering how internet
humor has changed.

There are hundreds of thousands of posts per day, with hundreds of millions of active users.
Because it's been a top website for over a decade, I realized I could make a sort of time
capsule to show what the internet found the most funny/interesting/infuriating at a
particular point in time.

### The Reddit API

Instead of using Reddit's own API, I found an even better search functionality in
[pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/). The Pushshift API was created by a
legend named Jason Baumgartner, who basically scraped the entire Reddit dataset and built an
API on top of it. As far as I can tell it's funded by donations (I donated) and
[r/pushshift](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/) is an active community for using the API.

## The UI

Instead of building out components from scratch, I decided to go with
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for the design system. AntD is an open-source React design
system that gives you tons of reusable components out of the box. Because I knew it would be
a simple website, one of the most important factors for choosing Ant Design is that it has a
nice [DatePicker](https://ant.design/components/date-picker/). It makes it easy to create
and handle interactions:

<iframe
  src='https://codesandbox.io/embed/basic-antd-4-22-2-liom67?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark'
  height='500'
  width='100%'
  style={{ border: 0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'hidden' }}
/>

### Retrieving posts

The Pushshift API is relatively simple, although the main website doesn't have the most
up-to-date documentation, which you can find through the r/pushshift subreddit. Here's how I
create the url for searching the different subreddits:

```ts
// startDate is the date in unix time
const endDate = (startDate || new Date().getTime() / 1000) + 86400; // 1 day later
const baseURl =
  'https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission/?sort_type=score&sort=desc&size=25';
const url = baseURl + `&after=${startDate}&before=${endDate}&subreddit=`;
```

That will return 25 posts with the most points (in decreasing order) between the two dates.
So to search for memes, for example, I just use that url and add a comma-separated list of
subreddits to search in:

```ts
const [memes, setMemes] = useState<Post[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

const fetchData = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  fetch(url + 'memes,memeeconomy,dankmemes,adviceanimals')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((res) => {
      setMemes(res.data.slice(0, 10));
    })
    .catch(() => {
      setMemes([]);
    })
    .finally(() => {
      // set loading to false
    });
};
```

Basically whenever the date is changed by the user, we call that API for the news, memes,
etc and set them in our state to display as posts.

For displaying the posts, I utilize the AntD
[Card component](https://ant.design/components/card/). I found that it looks best to have
images on their own cards, and the News/Predictions/Politics look better as a list on a
Card:

<MdxRow>
  <MdxCol>
    <Image
      src='/images/reddit-time-machine/news-list.png'
      alt='News list'
      width={425}
      height={432}
    />
  </MdxCol>
  <MdxCol>
    <Image
      src='/images/reddit-time-machine/img-card.png'
      alt='image card'
      width={422}
      height={403}
    />
  </MdxCol>
</MdxRow>

The ListView Card looks like this:

```tsx
const ListView: React.FC<ListViewProps> = (props) => {
  const { isMobile } = useWindowDimensions();
  const { title, posts, loading } = props;
  const LoadingListView = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((value, i) => (
    <Skeleton key={i} active avatar />
  ));

  const getThumbnail = (post: Post) => {
    const imgResolutions = post.preview?.images.resolutions ?? [];
    const thumbnailUrl =
      post.thumbnail && post.thumbnail !== 'default' ? post.thumbnail : undefined;
    const previewUrl =
      imgResolutions && imgResolutions.length ? imgResolutions[0].url : undefined;
    return thumbnailUrl ?? previewUrl ?? 'default_thumbnail.png';
  };

  return (
    <>
      <ListTitle>{title}</ListTitle>

      <Card style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
        {loading && LoadingListView}
        <List
          itemLayout='horizontal'
          dataSource={posts}
          locale={{ emptyText: `No ${title} to show` }}
          renderItem={(item) => (
            <List.Item>
              <List.Item.Meta
                avatar={
                  <Avatar
                    shape='square'
                    src={getThumbnail(item)}
                    size='large'
                    alt={item.title}
                  />
                }
                title={LinkWithAnalytics(
                  item.url,
                  item.title,
                  'external',
                  isMobile ? 12 : undefined
                )}
                description={LinkWithAnalytics(
                  item.full_link,
                  `r/${item.subreddit} · ${item.author} · ${item.score?.toString()} pts`,
                  'reddit',
                  isMobile ? 10 : undefined
                )}
              />
            </List.Item>
          )}
        />
      </Card>
    </>
  );
};
```

### The layout

I use Ant Design's [Grid](https://ant.design/components/grid/) to layout the content using
Rows and Cols, which can easily change width with the size of the screen using the
breakpoints (i.e. 'sm' is when `screen ≥ 576px`, 'md' is `screen ≥ 768px`, etc).

I struggled for a while to decide on how to order the content. I decided to keep the images
at the top because pictures catch your eye, and I decided that News should be first,
followed by politics.

## Adding Predictions

After sending the link in my college GroupMe, my friend Hugh made a suggestion: along with
news, I could display "predictions" from subreddits like r/futurology. It would be
interesting to see what people thought would be possible in the future, and how clearly
wrong some predictions can be. After messing around with the API, I realized that searching
"by [date]" gives the best results, and "predicts", "goal", or "prediction" result in a lot
of false positives.

Here's an interesting example from two random days in 2012 and 2016:

<MdxRow>
  <MdxCol>
    <RoundedImage
      src='/images/reddit-time-machine/predictions1.png'
      alt='predictions from 2012'
      width={433}
      height={405}
    />
  </MdxCol>
  <MdxCol>
    <RoundedImage
      src='/images/reddit-time-machine/predictions2.png'
      alt='predictions from 2016'
      width={436}
      height={523}
    />
  </MdxCol>
</MdxRow>

r/Futorology is an incredibly optimistic corner of the internet - there are countless
articles like **"No More Car Crashes by 2020?"**.
