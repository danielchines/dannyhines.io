## Short Explanation

I love Reddit, and I've always wondered about what the internet was talking about on a particular day in the past. So I created Reddit Time Machine, a way to view the most popular news, pictures and memes from a day in Reddit history.

## Material UI

[Material UI](https://mui.com/), or MUI, is yet another React framework that helps you build UI faster. It gives you dozens (hundreds?) of customizable components, which cover just about any UI appearance imaginable while keeping your UI consistent.

### Consideration for UX

## Lessons Learned

After this project, I felt more comfortable working with NextJS.
Before, it seems jarring to set up the routes.
